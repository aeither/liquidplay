# CAST: Crypto Asset Strategy Tactician - Implementation Plan

## Overview

CAST is an AI-powered agent that manages crypto assets across Aptos DeFi protocols, leveraging social intelligence to identify optimal strategies. Users can choose existing strategies or create custom ones based on their risk tolerance and preferred protocols, then allow CAST to execute them autonomously.

## Components

### 1. Protocol Intelligence System

**Purpose**: Monitor protocol activity, social sentiment, and performance metrics to identify trends and opportunities.

**Implementation**:
- Connect to Twitter API to monitor posts about supported Aptos protocols
- Analyze sentiment and user engagement for each protocol
- Track on-chain activity through blockchain events
- Collect and analyze APRs, TVL, and other protocol-specific metrics
- Rate protocols based on combined social and on-chain metrics

```typescript
// Core functionality:
// 1. Monitor social media for protocol mentions
// 2. Analyze on-chain metrics for protocol performance
// 3. Calculate protocol scores based on user-defined criteria
// 4. Provide real-time intelligence for strategy optimization
```

### 2. Strategy Optimizer

**Purpose**: Generate and optimize allocation strategies based on user preferences and protocol intelligence.

**Implementation**:
- Create customizable strategy templates for different risk profiles
- Allow users to define custom evaluation criteria
- Generate optimized allocations across multiple protocols
- Support strategy constraints (min/max allocations, protocol preferences)
- Dynamically adjust strategies based on changing market conditions

```typescript
// Core functionality:
// 1. Define strategy templates for various risk profiles
// 2. Apply user customization to strategies
// 3. Optimize allocations based on protocol intelligence
// 4. Validate strategies against constraints
```

### 3. Asset Manager

**Purpose**: Execute transactions across different Aptos protocols.

**Implementation**:
- Support operations across multiple Aptos protocols:
  - Joule: Lending/borrowing operations
  - Amnis: Staking operations
  - Thala: Staking and DEX operations
  - Echelon: Lending/borrowing operations
  - LiquidSwap: DEX operations
  - Panora: DEX aggregation operations
  - Aries: Lending/borrowing operations
  - Echo: Staking operations
- Secure transaction execution with validation and error handling
- Gas optimization for transaction batching
- Support transaction simulations before execution

```typescript
// Core functionality:
// 1. Protocol interface adapters for each supported protocol
// 2. Transaction construction and submission
// 3. Position management (entry and exit)
// 4. Error handling and retry mechanisms
```

### 4. Performance Tracker

**Purpose**: Monitor and analyze allocation performance across protocols.

**Implementation**:
- Track all executed transactions and protocol positions
- Calculate performance metrics (ROI, APR, relative performance)
- Generate performance reports comparing protocols
- Provide feedback to improve strategy optimization

```typescript
// Core functionality:
// 1. Record all protocol positions and transactions
// 2. Calculate performance metrics per protocol
// 3. Generate reports and visualizations
// 4. Feed performance data back to Strategy Optimizer
```

### 5. Notification System

**Purpose**: Keep users informed about strategy performance and executed actions.

**Implementation**:
- Telegram webhook integration for real-time notifications
- Customizable alert thresholds for different events
- Transaction confirmations and position updates
- Performance summaries and protocol battle results
- Strategy adjustment recommendations

```typescript
// Core functionality:
// 1. Format and send notifications via Telegram
// 2. Schedule periodic performance updates
// 3. Alert users to significant protocol developments
// 4. Provide actionable insights based on performance
```

## User Experience

### Strategy Creation and Customization

Users can:
1. Select from pre-defined strategies (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive)
2. Define custom allocation constraints for supported protocols
3. Create custom evaluation criteria with natural language prompts
4. Set notification preferences and rebalancing thresholds

### Protocol Battle Mechanics

The system will:
1. Evaluate each protocol based on social media engagement and on-chain metrics
2. Apply user-defined evaluation criteria to calculate protocol scores
3. Allocate funds according to the winning protocols based on user strategy
4. Track performance of allocations and compare against baseline strategies
5. Provide regular updates on the "battle" standings and performance
